# bundled_scripts

This directory contains scripts for `ralph-cli scan` command. They are
bundled with binary produced by `go build`, by utilising mechanisms
provided by `github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata`, so every change to them
should be followed by `go-bindata -prefix "bundled_scripts"
bundled_scripts/` (issued from the parent dir) - this will generate a
`bindata.go` file, which shouldn't be edited manually.

If you don't have `go-bindata` executable in your `$GOPATH`, then
install it with `go get -u github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/...` (it is
not included in `glide.yaml` because it is not dependency of
`ralph-cli` per se).
