A command-line interface for Ralph.

`ralph-cli` uses [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) for
managing its dependencies, so assuming that you already have it
installed on your system, all you have to do is `glide install` and
then `go build` (or `go install`).

BTW, this repo should be considered as "work in progress", so stay tuned!
